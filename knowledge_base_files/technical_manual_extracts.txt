Chapter 1: Introduction
1.1. Overview of the GRX-II Model
The GRX-II is a direct-drive, variable speed wind turbine designed for high-efficiency power generation in moderate to high wind speed environments. Key components include the rotor assembly, nacelle, direct-drive permanent magnet generator, and the control system.

1.2. Safety Precautions
Always adhere to standard lockout/tagout procedures before performing any maintenance. Ensure all capacitors are discharged and the turbine is fully braked and secured. Refer to Safety Manual Doc ID: SM-GRX2-001 for complete details.

Chapter 4: Nacelle Systems
4.1. Gearbox Assembly (if applicable, older models)
Note: The GRX-II primary model is direct-drive. For GRX-I legacy models with gearbox, refer to Appendix B.

4.2. Yaw System
The yaw system is responsible for orienting the nacelle towards the wind. Regular lubrication of yaw gears and inspection of yaw motor brushes is essential. Torque settings for yaw bolts: 350 Nm.

Chapter 7: Troubleshooting Common Faults
7.1. Blade Pitch Malfunctions
Pitch errors can lead to reduced efficiency or overspeed conditions. Check hydraulic pressure (if applicable) or electrical actuator integrity. Error codes P010-P075 relate to pitch system faults.

7.2. Generator Overheating
Continuous operation above nominal temperature (85Â°C internal winding) can degrade insulation and reduce generator lifespan. Verify cooling system functionality (fan operation, coolant levels if liquid-cooled). Check for obstructed air vents.

7.3. Vibration Analysis and Fault Signatures
The GRX-II is equipped with multiple vibration sensors. Baseline vibration signatures should be established post-commissioning. Section 7.3: High-frequency vibrations (115-125Hz) with harmonic sidebands often indicate early-stage gear tooth pitting. This is particularly relevant for auxiliary systems or older non-direct-drive components that might still use planetary gears for other functions, or if analyzing external coupled machinery. For the main generator, which is direct-drive, such frequencies might indicate bearing race issues or specific electrical faults manifesting as mechanical vibrations.

7.4. Electrical System Faults
Refer to the Electrical Schematics Manual (Doc ID: ES-GRX2-003). Common issues include contacter failures, inverter faults, or cable degradation. Inverter fault codes INV001-INV050 provide specific diagnostic information.

Appendix A: Lubrication Schedule
- Main Bearing: AeroLube Synth 500 - Annually or 8000 operating hours.
- Yaw Bearing: AeroGrease HTEP - Semi-annually.

Appendix B: Legacy Gearbox Maintenance (GRX-I Model Only)
B.1. Oil Analysis: Quarterly. Look for metal particles, water content.
B.2. Gear Inspection: Annually. Check for pitting, spalling, wear.
B.3. Bearing Replacement: As indicated by vibration analysis or oil condition. Typical lifespan 5-7 years under normal load.
