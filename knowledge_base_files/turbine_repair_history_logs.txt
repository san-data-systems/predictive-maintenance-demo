Turbine Maintenance & Repair Log - Master Record

Asset ID: DemoCorp_Turbine_001
Date: 2023-05-12
Technician: J. Abernathy
Work Order: WO2023050034
Issue: Low power output reported by SCADA.
Action: Investigated pitch system. Found hydraulic leak in actuator for Blade 2. Replaced seal kit (P/N PK-B2-009). Tested. Output normal.
Hours: 6

Asset ID: DemoCorp_Turbine_007
Date: 2023-07-20
Technician: S. Lee
Work Order: WO2023070112
Issue: Routine 6-month inspection.
Action: All checks normal. Lubricated yaw bearing. Cleaned nacelle air filters. No anomalies noted.
Hours: 4

Asset ID: DemoCorp_Turbine_004 (identical model to DemoCorp_Turbine_007)
Date: 2024-02-10
Technician: M. Valerius
Work Order: WO2024020015
Issue: Intermittent high vibration alerts from nacelle sensor VIB-N-02 (rear generator bearing). Asset continued operation with monitoring.
Action: Scheduled detailed inspection.
Hours: 1

Asset ID: DemoCorp_Turbine_004 (identical model to DemoCorp_Turbine_007)
Date: 2024-03-03
Technician: M. Valerius, R. Costa
Work Order: WO2024030002 (Follow-up to WO2024020015)
Issue: Critical vibration and increasing temperature at rear generator bearing. Turbine taken offline. Similar acoustic signature at 120Hz recorded 3 weeks prior to P/N G-5432 bearing assembly failure.
Action: Disassembled rear generator section. Found catastrophic failure of bearing P/N G-5432. Significant scoring on shaft. Replaced bearing assembly (P/N G-5432), performed minor shaft polishing. Oil flush and replacement.
Parts Used: G-5432 (Bearing Assembly), AeroLube Synth 500 (Oil)
Hours: 24 (2 technicians)
Notes: Recommend reviewing vibration thresholds for 120Hz band on similar GRX-II units. This specific acoustic pattern was a clear precursor.

Date: 2024-08-01
Technician: P. Jones
Work Order: WO2024080005
Issue: Annual main bearing lubrication.
Action: Main bearing lubricated with AeroLube Synth 500. Old grease samples taken for analysis - results pending. All other checks nominal.
Hours: 5
