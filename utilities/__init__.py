"""
Utilities Package
-----------------
This package provides common utility functions and classes shared across
different components of the predictive maintenance demo.

# Example (when common_utils.py has functions to expose):
# from .common_utils import setup_logger, format_data
# __all__ = ['setup_logger', 'format_data']

# For now, it can be empty or just have the docstring.
